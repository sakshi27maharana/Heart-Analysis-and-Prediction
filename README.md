# Heart-Analysis-and-Prediction
- using Machine learning algorithm with PCA ( Punning on http://localhost:5005/ )

### Objective
With the dataset provided for heart analysis, we have to analyse the possibilities of heart attack under various factors/features, and then a prediction from the classification will tell us that if a person is prone to heart attack or not. Th detailed analysis can be proceed with the exploratory data analysis (EDA). The classification for predication can be done using various machine learning model algorithms, choose the best suited model for heart attack analysis and finally save the model in the pickle (.pkl) file.

### About the dataset
Columns in the dataset are defined as :-

  Age : Age of the patient

  Sex : Sex of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female)

  exng : exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

  caa : number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy.

  cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type

    Value 1: typical angina

    Value 2: atypical angina

    Value 3: non-anginal pain

    Value 4: asymptomatic

  trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

  chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

  fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

  restecg : resting electrocardiographic results

    Value 0: normal

    Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

    Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

  oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

  slp : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping)

  thal : 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect.

  thalachh : maximum heart rate achieved

  output :

    0 = less chance of heart attack 

    1 = more chance of heart attack

### Project Data
The data was taken the kaggle dataset. We have been provided with the two dataset, that are -
    
    heart.csv : Stored the details of the various parameters required heart analysis
    o2Saturation.csv : Stored the details of the oxygen (o2) saturation level
